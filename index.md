    "Chiropractic care has had a big influence on my life. Although I was a surgical technologist, I changed professions to work in the chiropractic field after an illness. My well-being and health has greatly improved due to chiropractic. Advocating for chiropractic care means a lot to me. It is so rewarding to see our patients get well."
